## Edit your profile

There are two types of edits:

1. Making new changes then creating a Pull Request
2. Adding more changes to an existing open Pull request

### New Edits

If you want to edit your profile (for example update a link or remove a link), follow these steps:

1. Log into your GitHub Account
2. Go to your Repositories
3. Then click on the `LinkFree` repo (fork)
4. Now we need to make sure your fork is up to date. You can do this by clicking on `Sync fork` and click `Update branch` (if available)
5. Click `Go to file` and type your GitHub username
6. Click on your json file
7. Click the `edit` pencil icon at the top right
8. Make the changes you require

Changes could include:

- updating your bio
- adding a new section (see examples below)

| Sections                    | Json object        | Description                                                                                          |
| :-------------------------- | :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| statistics                  | displayStatsPublic | Display the total Profile views and link clicks                                                      |
| social shortcuts            | socials            | These are the icons at the top of your Profile                                                       |
| tags                        | tags               | These are search keywords for people to discover your Profile (for example `DevRel` or `Javascript`) |
| milestones                  | milestones         | Milestones you wish to highlight (for example "First day on GitHub")                                 |
| testimonials                | testimonials       | Include testimonials from other people in the community                                              |
| Virtual or in person events | events             | Show which events you are attending                                                                  |

For how to add each of these sections, please referring to their relevant guides.

9. Scroll to the bottom and commit new file by adding the commit messsage that starts `data: ` followed by your GitHub username (for example `data: SaraJaoude`)

You can skip `optional extended message`

11. Click `create new branch` and you can use the default name provided
12. Then click `Propose changes`
13. Click `compare across forks` and select the destination on the left and the source on the right
14. Click `Create pull request`
15. You will see a title and description for the Pull Request, fill these in and click `Create pull request`
16. Now you need to wait to have your Pull Request (changes) reviewed
17. You will receive a GitHub notification when you have a comment, review or your Pull Request has been merged
18. Once merged your profile will be available a few minutes later on the same custom url (for example: [linkfree.eddiehub.io/SaraJaoude](https://linkfree.eddiehub.io/SaraJaoude))

You can learn more about these later on in the documentation, in their respective sections.

### Adding more changes to an open Pull Request

The main two reasons for making additional edits to an open Pull Request are:

1. GitHub Action failed
2. Your Pull Request has received a comment requesting changes

To make further changes to an open Pull Request, follow these steps:

1. Go to your open Pull Request
2. Click on the tab `Files Changed`
3. At the top right of the file click on the 3 dots and then click `Edit file` (this will allow you to edit your file in your branch that is in your fork)
4. Make changes and commit these to the same branch (this should automatically be selected)

GitHub will automatically append these changes to your open Pull Request.

export default ({ children }) => <DocsLayout>{children}</DocsLayout>;
