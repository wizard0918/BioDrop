LinkFree connects audiences to all of your content with one link. It is an **Open Source** alternative to _Linktree_ implemented in JavaScript using NextJS, Tailwind and MongoDB.

We have features like...

- Profile bio
- Profile views
- Link clicks counter
- Milestones
- Testimonials
- Events

## Minimum profile

To add your profie you can create a json file in the `data/` directory with the contents...

```js
{
  "name": "Eddie Jaoude",
  "type": "personal",
  "bio": "Open Source DevRel | Founder of **EddieHub** | GitHub Star",
  "avatar": "https://github.com/eddiejaoude.png",
}
```

## How to add YOUR Profile

In the `data` directory, create a `.json` file with the same name as your GitHub username. For example, if your GitHub username is `eddiehub`, create a file named `eddiehub.json`. This will ensure that your username is unique.

**Optional fields: `milestones`, `type(personal | community)`, `socials`, `testimonials` and `events` **\
Looking for inspiration? You can view the following profiles for an example:

- [Eddie Jaoude](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree/blob/main/data/eddiejaoude.json)
- [Krupali Trivedi || Chai](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree/blob/main/data/krupalitrivedi.json)
- [Pradumna Saraf](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree/blob/main/data/Pradumnasaraf.json)

Your brand new file should look something similar to this one:

> **Note**: add/remove `links` objects to customise your Profile, `milestones` are optional

```json
{
  "name": "YOUR NAME",
  "displayStatsPublic": true,
  "type": "personal",
  "bio": "Open Source Enthusiast!",
  "avatar": "https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.png",
  "tags": ["javascript", "typescript"],
  "socials": [
    {
      "platform": "twitter",
      "url": "https://twitter.com/YOUR_TWITTER_USERNAME"
    },
    { "platform": "github", "url": "https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME" }
  ],
  "links": [
    {
      "name": "Follow me on GitHub",
      "url": "https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME",
      "icon": "github"
    },
    {
      "name": "Follow me on Twitter",
      "url": "https://twitter.com/YOUR_TWITTER_USERNAME",
      "icon": "twitter"
    }
  ],
  "milestones": [
    {
      "title": "Started Freelancing",
      "date": "December 2021",
      "icon": "dollar",
      "color": "grey",
      "description": "Started freelancing",
      "url": "https://www.eddiejaoude.io/"
    }
  ]
}
```

Your URL will be `https://linkfree.eddiehub.io/<yourusername>`

For example: https://linkfree.eddiehub.io/eddiejaoude

To include your `avatar`, you have to replace `<yourusername>` with your **GitHub username** in the format of `https://github.com/<yourusername>.png` and it will automatically be fetched from your GitHub account.

For example: `http://github.com/eddiejaoude.png`

Note: After your PR gets merged, the project still needs to be deployed for your Profile to be displayed.

export default ({ children }) => <DocsLayout>{children}</DocsLayout>;
