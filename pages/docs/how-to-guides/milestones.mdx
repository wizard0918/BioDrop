### Add Milestone

1. Find your `json` file in the `data` folder using your GitHub username, for example `data/sarajaoude.json`

_If you need help on how to edit this file, please see the [Editing guide](/docs/how-to-guides/editing)_

2. Add a collection called `milestones` at the root of your json file which will contain one or more social objects. Each social object must have six fields, `titel`, `date`, `icon`, `color`, `description` and `url`, which will look like this:

```js
{
    "title": "Started Freelancing",
    "date": "May 2010",
    "icon": "FaDollarSign",
    "color": "grey",
    "description": "Started my own business",
    "url": "https://www.eddiejaoude.io/"
}
```

| Property    | Description                                                 |
| :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Title       | Main heading of the milestone                               |
| Date        | Month and Year                                              |
| Icon        | What icon would you like displayed with this milestone      |
| Color       | What color would you like this milestone to be displayed in |
| Description | More details about the milestone                            |
| Url         | Where can people learn more about the milestone             |

This is what a complete example looks like:

```js
"milestones": [
    {
        "title": "Started Freelancing",
        "date": "May 2010",
        "icon": "FaDollarSign",
        "color": "grey",
        "description": "Started my own business",
        "url": "https://www.eddiejaoude.io/"
    }
]
```
