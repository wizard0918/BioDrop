## How much does it cost to use

It is complete free to use LinkFree.

## Is it all Open Source

Yes LinkFree is 100% Open Source. You can use our hosted version, or you can host it yourself in "single user mode". We recommend using the hosted version here, so that your profile is more discoverable and you don't have to do the upgrades and updates yourself.

## Does this count towards Hacktoberfest

- Pull requests which add or edit your information in a `data/${yourname}.json` file will NOT be counted for Hacktoberfest.
- Pull requests which improve the codebase, documentation, or other aspects of the project and are in line with the core values of the event will count. Maintainers will opt-in these PRs by applying the `hacktoberfest-accepted` label.
