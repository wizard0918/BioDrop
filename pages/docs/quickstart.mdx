## Add your profile

There are 3 ways you can add your profile, but for this Quickstart we will use the GitHub UI.

To do this, you need a GitHub account. If you do not have one yet, you can create one for free with an email address and password.

1. Log in to your GitHub Account
2. Visit the [LinkFree repo](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree)
3. If you wish to be kept up to date with the repo, hit that "Star" at the top right
4. Click on Fork
5. Accept the default fork creating a copy of the LinkFree project in your account - this will take you to the forked repo
6. Click add file and select "create new file"
7. In the file path at the top, add `data/` then with your GitHub username exactly as it appears, and append `.json` (for example `data/SaraJaoude.json`)
8. For the file contents use the json structure below:

```js
{
  "name": "Sara Jaoude",
  "displayStatsPublic": true,
  "type": "personal",
  "bio": "Lawyer turned **Digital Nomad**. Travel enthusiast Yoga & Peloton aficionado",
  "avatar": "https://github.com/SaraJaoude.png",
}
```

| field              | type                 | description                                                                                                   |
| :----------------- | :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| name               | string               | Your display name on your Profile                                                                             |
| displayStatsPublic | `true` or `false`    | Display your page view counter and link click counter                                                         |
| type               | personal / community | The type of account, is it a single person or a community                                                     |
| bio                | string               | Your description about yourself (you an use markdown here)                                                    |
| avatar             | string               | Here we recommend you use a magic GitHub link for your profile which is your GitHub link appended with `.png` |

9. Now add links to your social media and other content (for example: website) so they appear on your Profile.

```js
  "links": [
    {
      "name": "Follow me on Twitter",
      "url": "https://twitter.com/SaraJaoude",
      "icon": "FaTwitter"
    }
  ]
```

| field | type   | description                                                   |
| :---- | :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| name  | string | The display name for the button                               |
| url   | string | Full url to the resource                                      |
| icon  | string | The icon you would like displayed, please use available icons |

To add more links add another object inside the links collection. For example:

```js
  "links": [
    {
      "name": "Follow me on Twitter",
      "url": "https://twitter.com/SaraJaoude",
      "icon": "FaTwitter"
    },
    {
      "name": "Follow me on Instagram",
      "url": "https://twitter.com/EddieAndSaraExplore",
      "icon": "FaInstagram"
    }
  ]
```

10. Scroll to the bottom and commit new file by adding the commit messsage that starts `data: ` followed by your GitHub username (for example `data: SaraJaoude`)

You can skip `optional extended message`

11. Click `create new branch` and you can use the default name provided
12. Then click `Propose new file`
