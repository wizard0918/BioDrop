## Add your profile

There are 3 ways you can add your profile, but for this Quickstart we will use the GitHub UI.

To do this, you need a GitHub account. If you do not have one yet, you can create one for free with an email address and password.

1. Log in to your GitHub Account
2. Visit the [LinkFree repo](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree)
3. If you wish to be kept up to date with the repo, hit that "Star" at the top right
4. Click on Fork
5. Accept the default fork creating a copy of the LinkFree project in your account - this will take you to the forked repo
6. Click add file and select "create new file"
7. In the file path at the top, add `data/` then with your GitHub username exactly as it appears, and append `.json` (for example `data/SaraJaoude.json`)
8. For the file contents use the json structure below:

```js
{
  "name": "Sara Jaoude",
  "displayStatsPublic": true,
  "type": "personal",
  "bio": "Lawyer turned **Digital Nomad**. Travel enthusiast Yoga & Peloton aficionado",
  "avatar": "https://github.com/SaraJaoude.png",
}
```

| field              | type                 | description                                                                                                   |
| :----------------- | :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| name               | string               | Your display name on your Profile                                                                             |
| displayStatsPublic | `true` or `false`    | Display your page view counter and link click counter                                                         |
| type               | personal / community | The type of account, is it a single person or a community                                                     |
| bio                | string               | Your description about yourself (you an use markdown here)                                                    |
| avatar             | string               | Here we recommend you use a magic GitHub link for your profile which is your GitHub link appended with `.png` |

9. Now add links to your social media and other content (for example: website) so they appear on your Profile.

```js
  "links": [
    {
      "name": "Follow me on Twitter",
      "url": "https://twitter.com/SaraJaoude",
      "icon": "FaTwitter"
    }
  ]
```

| field | type   | description                                                   |
| :---- | :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| name  | string | The display name for the button                               |
| url   | string | Full url to the resource                                      |
| icon  | string | The icon you would like displayed, please use available icons |

To add more links add another object inside the links collection. For example:

```js
  "links": [
    {
      "name": "Follow me on Twitter",
      "url": "https://twitter.com/SaraJaoude",
      "icon": "FaTwitter"
    },
    {
      "name": "Follow me on Instagram",
      "url": "https://twitter.com/EddieAndSaraExplore",
      "icon": "FaInstagram"
    }
  ]
```

10. Commit new file by adding the commit messsage that starts `data: ` followed by your GitHub username (for example `data: SaraJaoude`)

You can skip `optional extended message`

11. Click `create new branch` and you can use the default name provided
12. Then click `Propose new file`
13. Click `compare across forks` and you will see 4 drop downs

| Dropdown     | Description                          | Example values               |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| 1st dropdown | Base repository (destination)        | `EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree` |
| 2nd dropdown | Base repository branch (destination) | `main`                       |
| 3rd dropdown | Your repository (source)             | `your-username/LinkFree`     |
| 4th dropdown | Your repository branch (source)      | `your-username-patch-1`      |

14. Click `Create pull request`
15. The description will be filled with a template, please fill in the appropiate sections
16. Click `Create pull request`
17. Now you need to wait to have your Pull Request (changes) reviewed
18. You will receive a GitHub notification when you have a comment, review or your Pull Request has been merged
19. Once merged your profile will be available a few minutes later on your custom url (for example: [linkfree.eddiehub.io/SaraJaoude](https://linkfree.eddiehub.io/SaraJaoude))

## How to add YOUR Profile

In the `data` directory, create a `.json` file with the same name as your GitHub username. For example, if your GitHub username is `eddiehub`, create a file named `eddiehub.json`. This will ensure that your username is unique.

**Optional fields: `milestones`, `type(personal | community)`, `socials`, `testimonials` and `events` **\
Looking for inspiration? You can view the following profiles for an example:

- [Eddie Jaoude](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree/blob/main/data/eddiejaoude.json)
- [Krupali Trivedi || Chai](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree/blob/main/data/krupalitrivedi.json)
- [Pradumna Saraf](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree/blob/main/data/Pradumnasaraf.json)

Your brand new file should look something similar to this one:

> **Note**: add/remove `links` objects to customise your Profile, `milestones` are optional

```json
{
  "name": "YOUR NAME",
  "displayStatsPublic": true,
  "type": "personal",
  "bio": "Open Source Enthusiast!",
  "avatar": "https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.png",
  "tags": ["javascript", "typescript"],
  "socials": [
    {
      "platform": "twitter",
      "url": "https://twitter.com/YOUR_TWITTER_USERNAME"
    },
    { "platform": "github", "url": "https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME" }
  ],
  "links": [
    {
      "name": "Follow me on GitHub",
      "url": "https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME",
      "icon": "github"
    },
    {
      "name": "Follow me on Twitter",
      "url": "https://twitter.com/YOUR_TWITTER_USERNAME",
      "icon": "twitter"
    }
  ],
  "milestones": [
    {
      "title": "Started Freelancing",
      "date": "December 2021",
      "icon": "dollar",
      "color": "grey",
      "description": "Started freelancing",
      "url": "https://www.eddiejaoude.io/"
    }
  ]
}
```

Your URL will be `https://linkfree.eddiehub.io/<yourusername>`

For example: https://linkfree.eddiehub.io/eddiejaoude

To include your `avatar`, you have to replace `<yourusername>` with your **GitHub username** in the format of `https://github.com/<yourusername>.png` and it will automatically be fetched from your GitHub account.

For example: `http://github.com/eddiejaoude.png`

Note: After your PR gets merged, the project still needs to be deployed for your Profile to be displayed.

export default ({ children }) => <DocsLayout>{children}</DocsLayout>;
