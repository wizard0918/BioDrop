> ### A note for Hacktoberfest participants:
>
> - Pull requests which add or edit your information in a `data/${yourname}.json` file will NOT be counted for Hacktoberfest.
> - Pull requests which improve the codebase, documentation, or other aspects of the project and are in line with the core values of the event will count. The project contains the `hacktoberfest` topic, so the PRs will be automatically counted towards Hacktoberfest. However, profile update PRs will have the label `invalid` and therefore won't be counted towards this event.

# LinkFree by EddieHub

- It was initially created on a YouTube [live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jorl_vcp-Ew).
