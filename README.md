# What is LinkFree?

LinkFree is the Open Source alternative to LinkTree. A platform where people in tech can have a single hub to showcase their content in order to accelerate their career, whilst contributing to an Open Source project and being part of a community which has a say in where the project is going.

Your profile will have links to your social media and content. You can also add your timeline, testimonials and upcoming events that you are participating in.

Here is an example of a LinkFree Profile...

![Example profile on LinkFree](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/624760/207048057-0f8cc74f-cc50-4cb3-b1a9-7e37f1a66d2c.png)

## üë®‚Äçüíª Demo

Example profile for [Eddie Jaoude](https://linkfree.eddiehub.io/eddiejaoude)

## üëá Prerequisites

You can use [Gitpod in the cloud for free](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree) or you can set this up locally with the following steps.

Before contributing or adding a new feature, please make sure you have already installed the following tools:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## QUICKSTART

1. copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update any details required
1. mongodb is required, it is possible to use `docker-compose up` to start the mongodb service
1. `npm install`
1. `npm run dev`

## üë®‚Äçüíª Contributing

- Contributions make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create.
- Any contributions you make are **truly appreciated**.
- Check out our [contribution guidelines](./docs/contributing/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

## üé≠ To Add Your Profile

In the `data` directory, create a `.json` file with the same name as your GitHub username. For example, if your GitHub username is `eddiehub`, create a file named `eddiehub.json`. This will ensure that your username is unique. 

**Optional fields: `milestones` and `type(personal | community)`**\
Looking for inspiration? You can view the following profiles for an example:

- [Eddie Jaoude](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree/blob/main/data/eddiejaoude.json)
- [Naomi Carrigan](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree/blob/main/data/nhcarrigan.json)
- [Kaiwalya Koparkar](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree/blob/main/data/kaiwalyakoparkar.json)

Your brand new file should look something similar to this one:

> **Note**: add/remove `links` objects to customise your profile, `milestones` are optional

```json
{
  "name": "YOUR NAME",
  "displayStatsPublic": true,
  "type": "personal",
  "bio": "Open Source Enthusiast!",
  "avatar": "https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.png",
  "tags": ["javascript", "typescript"],
  "socials": [
    { "platform": "twitter", "url": "https://twitter.com/YOUR_TWITTER_USERNAME" },
    { "platform": "github", "url": "https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME" }
  ],
  "links": [
    {
      "name": "Follow me on GitHub",
      "url": "https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME",
      "icon": "github"
    },
    {
      "name": "Follow me on Twitter",
      "url": "https://twitter.com/YOUR_TWITTER_USERNAME",
      "icon": "twitter"
    }
  ],
  "milestones": [
    {
      "title": "Started Freelancing",
      "date": "December 2021",
      "icon": "dollar",
      "color": "grey",
      "description": "Started freelancing",
      "url": "https://www.eddiejaoude.io/"
    }
  ]
}
```

Your URL will be `https://linkfree.eddiehub.io/<yourusername>`

For example: <https://linkfree.eddiehub.io/eddiejaoude>

To include your `avatar`, you have to replace `<yourusername>` with your **GitHub username** in the format of `https://github.com/<yourusername>.png` and it will automatically be fetched from your GitHub account.

For example: <http://github.com/eddiejaoude.png>

Note: After your PR gets merged, the project still needs to be deployed for your profile to be displayed.

### Available Icons:

Check [Icons.md](/icons.md) for all the supported icons.

### Single user mode

If you wish to self-host this app for a single user, follow the same steps as above, but then in the file `config/user.json` add your username.

For example

```json
{
  "username": "eddiejaoude"
}
```
