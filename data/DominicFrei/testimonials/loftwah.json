  "description": "I had the pleasure of collaborating with Dominic on an open-source project called GrittR, and he's an exceptional developer. Dominic has over ten years of experience in iOS app development and is equally skilled in Unity development, as evidenced by the impressive portfolio of games he's created.\n\nBut what impressed me most about Dominic was his passion for his project, Kookagram. He shared his ideas with me, and I was blown away by his creativity and attention to detail. Dominic has put a lot of thought and effort into developing Kookagram, and I do not doubt it will succeed.\n\nDominic is a great team player and collaborator, always willing to share his expertise and ideas to help make projects even better. He has a curious and enthusiastic approach to development, which makes him a joy to work with.\n\nIf you're looking for a developer equally skilled in iOS and Unity development and passionate about their own project, I highly recommend Dominic.",
